                    <li> Playing the guitar improves the grey matter in the brain resulting in improved memory power.<br>
                        This is proven true by the fact that you have to memorize chords and patterns which act as a good workout for your brain.
                    <li> Practicing the guitar regularly can enhance your concentration and expand your attention span. <br> 
                        Focusing becomes a habit for your mind and will help you concentrate better on other everyday chores too.</li>
                    <li>Listening is pivotal when learning to play the guitar. With consistency, you can recognize chords by ear,<br>
                         thanks to all the listening youâ€™ve been doing from the beginning. Thus, your ears become sharp.  </li>
                    <li> Playing guitar is a great way to get out of your head and become more mindful of the present. <br>
                        If you tend to dwell on past events and/or stress about the future, practicing an instrument will help you live in the moment.</li>
